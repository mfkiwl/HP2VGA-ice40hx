# HP2VGA

Project to replace the display on the HP1662AS logic analyser with a VGA LCD display. 

The project uses a Texas Instruments TVP7002 Video ADC to digitise the video signal, a Lattice iCE40HX8K FPGA to buffer and upscale the video, and an Analog Devices ADV7125 to output the VGA signal to an LCD monitor.
